# üëª GhostCipher  

A fun simulation tool that mimics advanced penetration testing and cryptanalysis systems.  

Watch binary numbers cascade in the background while the "Advanced Cryptanalysis Engine" pretends to break encryption protocols! üîê  

## Features  
- **Realistic hacking simulation** interface with "ADVANCED PENETRATION SYSTEM" theme  
- Animated **binary code background** for authentic feel  
- Target input support (name, phone number, or email)  
- **Simulated scanning process** with realistic progress indicators  
- "Target Compromised" result display for entertainment  
- **Works offline** after initial loading  
- Mobile-friendly responsive design üì±
